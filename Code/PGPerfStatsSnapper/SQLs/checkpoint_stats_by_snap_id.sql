-- checkpoints_timed: Number of scheduled checkpoints (due to checkpoint_timeout being reached) that have been performed. Desirable.
-- checkpoints_req: Number of checkpoints that had to be requested due to heavy write activity (due to max_wal_size being reached)
-- buffers_checkpoint: Number of buffers written during checkpoints
-- buffers_clean: Number of buffers written by the background writer (bgwriter) to help offload work off of checkpoint processes. Desirable.
-- buffers_backend: Number of buffers written directly by a backend processes (clients) because it couldn't find empty buffers in shared_buffers. Not desirable.
-- buffers_alloc: Number of new buffers allocated by backend processes (clients)

-- buffers_clean should be greater than buffers_backend. Otherwise, you should increase bgwriter_lru_multiplier and decrease bgwriter_delay. Note, it also may be a sign that you have insufficient shared buffers and hot part of your data donâ€™t fit into shared buffers and forced to travel between RAM and disks.
